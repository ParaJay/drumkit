> play sounds with keys 1-9, the buttons or by entering a beat and clicking play

example beat: 3+4 3 3+7 3

> 8th notes referenced by their key (1 - 9)

> input must be separated by a space indicating they are to be played separately

> combining sounds with a + will play the sounds at the same time

planned changes:
> update sounds, add more variety

> upgrade loop logic
